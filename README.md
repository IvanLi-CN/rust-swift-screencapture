This is a screen capture library developed in Rust + Swift, implemented using the [ScreenCaptureKit](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/screencapturekit/) framework. Supports macOS 13.0+.

*Warning: this library is for simple functional verification, and I'm not a Swift developer, so I'm not sure if the code implementation makes sense.*

## Use
